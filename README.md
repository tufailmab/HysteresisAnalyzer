# HysteresisAnalyzer
HysteresisAnalyzer is a Python-based post-processing tool for automatic detection of loading cycles and energy dissipation calculation from force–displacement hysteresis data. It separates cycles, computes hysteresis loop areas, and generates plots and structured outputs for research and engineering use.
